# Product Vision

## Vision Statement

For the UP students who worry they might forget some evaluation activity, the UniCalendar is a simple to use calendar that presents the user's activities deadlines. 

Having in mind that teachers may not use moodle's activities scheduling feature, we plan to create a shared document between students in which they could add activity dates that they deem important. Therefore, this product will allow students to collaborate by maintaining a document updated with their deadlines and/or evaluation dates, creating a more complete calendar that'll result in a better experience for every student in the UP community.

## Main Features

 - Visualize a calendar with the deadlines of the activities;
 - Filter which events are shown to the user;
 - Export the schedule to multiple calendar apps.

## Assumptions and dependencies

- Student activities from a spreadsheet.
