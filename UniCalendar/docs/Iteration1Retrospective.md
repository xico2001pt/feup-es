## a) What went well?

The initial division of work was well thought out, we managed to conclude all the planned work with a consistent workflow. The amount of work was spread across the group evenly and organized. Every work item and user story had it's own branch and corresponding pull request. The initial release of the app tackled the viewing of activities with success.

## b) What should we do differently?

Develop more unit and acceptance tests and further enhance our division of work.

## c) What still puzzles me?

Certain flutter widget behaviour. Uni4all code design is challenging to understand and to develop code for.
